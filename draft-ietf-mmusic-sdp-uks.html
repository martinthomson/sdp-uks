  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) <a href="#TLS13" class="xref">[TLS13]</a> with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <a href="#SDP" class="xref">[SDP]</a> is defined in <a href="#FINGERPRINT" class="xref">[FINGERPRINT]</a>.  Further use with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <a href="#DTLS" class="xref">[DTLS]</a> and the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) <a href="#SRTP" class="xref">[SRTP]</a> is defined as DTLS-SRTP <a href="#DTLS-SRTP" class="xref">[DTLS-SRTP]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">In these specifications, key agreement is performed using TLS or DTLS, with authentication being tied back to the session description (or SDP) through the use of certificate fingerprints.  Communication peers check that a hash, or fingerprint, provided in the SDP matches the certificate that is used in the TLS or DTLS handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">WebRTC identity (see Section 7 of <a href="#WEBRTC-SEC" class="xref">[WEBRTC-SEC]</a>) and SIP identity <a href="#SIP-ID" class="xref">[SIP-ID]</a> both provide a mechanism that binds an external identity to the certificate fingerprints from a session description.  However, this binding is not integrity-protected and therefore vulnerable to an identity misbinding attack - or unknown key-share (UKS) attack - where the attacker binds their identity to the fingerprint of another entity.  A successful attack leads to the creation of sessions where peers are confused about the identify of the participants.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This document describes a TLS extension that can be used in combination with these identity bindings to prevent this attack.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">A similar attack is possible with the use of certificate fingerprints alone.  Though attacks in this setting are likely infeasible in existing deployments due to the narrow conditions necessary (see <a href="#limits" class="xref">Section 2.1</a>), this document also describes mitigations for this attack.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">The mechanisms defined in this document are intended to strengthen the protocol by preventing the use of unknown key shares in combination with other protocol or implementation vulnerabilities.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">This document assumes that signaling is integrity protected.  However, as Section 7 of <a href="#FINGERPRINT" class="xref">[FINGERPRINT]</a> explains, many deployments that use SDP do not guarantee integrity of session signaling and so are vulnerable to other attacks.  <a href="#FINGERPRINT" class="xref">[FINGERPRINT]</a> offers key continuity mechanisms as a potential means of reducing exposure to attack in the absence of integrity protection.  <a href="#continuity" class="xref">Section 2.2</a> provides some analysis of the effect of key continuity in relation to the described attacks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">The key words &#8220;MUST&#8221;, &#8220;MUST NOT&#8221;, &#8220;REQUIRED&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL&#8221;, &#8220;SHALL NOT&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD NOT&#8221;, &#8220;RECOMMENDED&#8221;, &#8220;NOT RECOMMENDED&#8221;, &#8220;MAY&#8221;, and &#8220;OPTIONAL&#8221; in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">[RFC2119]</a> <a href="#RFC8174" class="xref">[RFC8174]</a> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#uks" id="uks">Unknown Key-Share Attack</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">In an unknown key-share attack <a href="#UKS" class="xref">[UKS]</a>, a malicious participant in a protocol claims to control a key that is in reality controlled by some other actor.  This arises when the identity associated with a key is not properly bound to the key.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">An endpoint that can acquire the certificate fingerprint of another entity can advertise that fingerprint as their own in SDP.  An attacker can use a copy of that fingerprint to cause a victim to communicate with another unaware victim, even though it believes that it is communicating with the attacker.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">When the identity of communicating peers is established by higher-layer signaling constructs, such as those in SIP identity <a href="#SIP-ID" class="xref">[SIP-ID]</a> or WebRTC <a href="#WEBRTC-SEC" class="xref">[WEBRTC-SEC]</a>, this allows an attacker to bind their own identity to a session with any other entity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">The attacker obtains an identity assertion for an identity it controls, but binds that to the fingerprint of one peer.  The attacker is then able to cause a TLS connection to be established where two endpoints communicate.  The victim that has its fingerprint copied by the attack correctly believes that it is communicating with the other victim; however, the other victim incorrectly believes that it is communicating with the attacker.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">A similar attack can be mounted without any communications established based on the SDP <samp>fingerprint</samp> attribute <a href="#FINGERPRINT" class="xref">[FINGERPRINT]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">This attack is an aspect of SDP-based protocols that the technique known as third-party call control (3PCC) <a href="#RFC3725" class="xref">[RFC3725]</a> relies on.  3PCC exploits the potential for the identity of a signaling peer to be different than the media peer, allowing the media peer to be selected by the signaling peer.  <a href="#byebye-3pcc" class="xref">Section 2.3</a> describes the consequences of the mitigations described here for systems that use 3PCC.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> <a href="#limits" id="limits">Limits on Attack Feasibility</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">The use of TLS with SDP depends on the integrity of session signaling.  Assuming signaling integrity limits the capabilities of an attacker in several ways.  In particular:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>An attacker can only modify the parts of the session signaling for a session that they are part of, which is limited to their own offers and answers.</li>
<li>No entity will complete communications with a peer unless they are willing to participate in a session with that peer.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">The combination of these two constraints make the spectrum of possible attacks quite limited.  An attacker is only able to switch its own certificate fingerprint for a valid certificate that is acceptable to its peer.  Attacks therefore rely on joining two separate sessions into a single session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">However, the second condition might not be necessary when using an identity binding such as those defined in <a href="#WEBRTC" class="xref">[WEBRTC]</a> or <a href="#SIP-ID" class="xref">[SIP-ID]</a>.  When using an identity binding, the threat model assumes the possibility of attack by an entity with access to the signaling channel.  Removing this constraint makes attacks considerably more feasible.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> <a href="#continuity" id="continuity">Interactions with Key Continuity</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">Systems that use key continuity might be able to detect an unknown key-share attack if a session with either the attacker or the geniune peer (i.e., the victim whose fingerprint was copied by an attacker) was established in the past.  Whether this is possible depends on how key continuity is implemented.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">Implementations that maintain a single database of identities with an index on peer keys could discover that the identity saved for the peer key does not match the claimed identity.  Such an implementation could notice the disparity between the actual keys (those copied from a victim) and the expected keys (those of the attacker).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">In comparison, implementations that first match based on peer identity could treat an unknown key-share attack as though their peer had used a newly-configured device.  The apparent addition of a new device could generate user-visible notices (e.g., &#8220;Mallory appears to have a new device&#8221;).  However, such an event is not always considered alarming; some implementations might silently save a new key.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> <a href="#byebye-3pcc" id="byebye-3pcc">Third-Party Call Control</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">Third-party call control (3PCC) <a href="#RFC3725" class="xref">[RFC3725]</a> is a technique where a signaling peer establishes a call that is terminated by a different entity.  This attack is very similar to the 3PCC technique, except where the TLS peers are aware of the use of 3PCC.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">For 3PCC to work with the proposed mechanisms, TLS peers need to be aware of the signaling so that they can correctly generate (and check) the extension.  It is understood that this technique will prevent the use of 3PCC if peers are not able to access signaling.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#id" id="id">Attack on Identity Bindings</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The identity assertions used for WebRTC (Section 7 of <a href="#WEBRTC-SEC" class="xref">[WEBRTC-SEC]</a>) and the SIP PASSPoRT using in SIP identity (<a href="#SIP-ID" class="xref">[SIP-ID]</a>, <a href="#PASSPoRT" class="xref">[PASSPoRT]</a>) are bound to the certificate fingerprint of an endpoint.  An attacker causes an identity binding to be created that binds an identity they control to the fingerprint of a victim.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">An attacker can thereby cause a victim to believe that they are communicating with an attacker-controlled identity, when they are really talking to another entity of the attacker&#8217;s choice.  The attacker only needs to create an identity assertion that covers a certificate fingerprint of their choosing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">The problem might appear to be caused by the fact that the entity that certifies the identity binding is not required to verify that the entity requesting the binding controls the keys associated with the fingerprints.  Both SIP and WebRTC identity providers are not required to perform this validation.  This is not an issue because verifying control of the associated keys is not a necessary condition for a secure protocol, nor would it be sufficient to prevent attack <a href="#SIGMA" class="xref">[SIGMA]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">A simple solution to this problem is suggested by <a href="#SIGMA" class="xref">[SIGMA]</a>.  The identity of endpoints is included under a message authentication code (MAC) during the cryptographic handshake.  Endpoints then validate that their peer has provided an identity that matches their expectations.  In TLS, the Finished message provides a MAC over the entire handshake, so that including the identity in a TLS extension is sufficient to implement this solution.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">Rather than include a complete identity binding - which could be sizeable - a collision- and pre-image-resistant hash of the binding is included in a TLS extension.

<p class="figure">Figure 2: Example Attack Scenario using Fingerprints</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">In this scenario, there are two sessions initiated at the same time by Norma.  Signaling is shown with single lines (&#8216;-&#8216;), DTLS and media with double lines (&#8216;=&#8217;).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">The first session is established with Mallory, who falsely uses Patsy&#8217;s certificate fingerprint (denoted with &#8216;fp=P&#8217;).  A second session is initiated between Norma and Patsy.  Signaling for both sessions is permitted to complete.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.6">Once signaling is complete on the session that is ostensibly between Mallory and Norma is complete.  Mallory begins forwarding DTLS and media packets sent to her by Norma to Patsy.  These packets denoted &#8216;DTLS1&#8217; because Norma associates these with the first signaling session (&#8216;signaling1&#8217;).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.7">Mallory also intercepts packets from Patsy and forwards those to Norma at the transport address that Norma associates with Mallory.  These packets are denoted &#8216;DTLS2&#8217; to indicate that Patsy associates these with the second signaling session (&#8216;signaling2&#8217;), however Norma will interpret these as being associated with the first signaling session (&#8216;signaling1&#8217;).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.8">The second signaling exchange - &#8216;signaling2&#8217;, between Norma and Patsy - is permitted to continue to the point where Patsy believes that it has succeeded.  This ensures that Patsy believes that she is communicating with Norma.  In the end, Norma believes that she is communicating with Mallory, when she is really communicating with Patsy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.9">Though Patsy needs to believe that the second signaling session has been successfully established, Mallory has no real interest in seeing that session complete.  Mallory only needs to ensure that Patsy does not abandon the session prematurely.  For this reason, it might be necessary to permit the signaling from Patsy to reach Norma to allow Patsy to receive a call completion signal, such as a SIP ACK.  Once the second session completes, Mallory might cause DTLS packets sent by Norma to Patsy to be dropped, though these will likely be discarded by Patsy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.10">For the attacked session to be sustained beyond the point that Norma detects errors in the second session, Mallory also needs to block any signaling that Norma might send to Patsy asking for the call to be abandoned.  Otherwise, Patsy might receive a notice that the call is failed and thereby abort the call.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.11">This attack creates an asymmetry in the beliefs about the identity of peers.  However, this attack is only possible if the victim (Norma) is willing to conduct two sessions nearly simultaneously, if the attacker (Mallory) is on the network path between the victims, and if the same certificate - and therefore SDP <samp>fingerprint</samp> attribute value - is used in both sessions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.12">Where ICE <a href="#ICE" class="xref">[ICE]</a> is used, Mallory also needs to ensure that connectivity between Patsy and Norma succeed, either by forwarding checks or answering and generating the necessary messages.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">An attack on DTLS-SRTP is possible because the identity of peers involved is not established prior to establishing the call.  Endpoints use certificate fingerprints as a proxy for authentication, but as long as fingerprints are used in multiple calls, they are vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">The solution to this problem is to assign a new identifier to communicating peers.  Each endpoint assigns their peer a unique identifier during call signaling.  The peer echoes that identifier in the TLS handshake, binding that identity into the session.  Including this new identity in the TLS handshake means that it will be covered by the TLS Finished message, which is necessary to authenticate it (see <a href="#SIGMA" class="xref">[SIGMA]</a>).  Validating that peers use the correct identifier then means that the session is established between the correct two endpoints.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">This solution relies on the unique identifier given to DTLS sessions using the SDP <samp>tls-id</samp> attribute <a href="#DTLS-SDP" class="xref">[DTLS-SDP]</a>.  This field is already required to be unique.  Thus, no two offers or answers from the same client will have the same value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">A new <samp>external_session_id</samp> extension is added to the TLS or DTLS handshake for connections that are established as part of the same call or real-time session.

When used with SDP, the value includes the <samp>tls-id</samp> attribute from the SDP that the endpoint generated when negotiating the session.  This document only defines use of this extension for SDP; other methods of external session negotiation can use this extension to include a unique session identifier.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">The <samp>extension_data</samp> for the <samp>external_session_id</samp> extension contains a ExternalSessionId struct, described below using the syntax defined in <a href="#TLS13" class="xref">[TLS13]</a>:</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">Use of session identifiers does not prevent an attacker from establishing two concurrent sessions with different peers and forwarding signaling from those peers to each other.  Concatenating two signaling sessions creates a situation where both peers believe that they are talking to the attacker when they are talking to each other.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">This kind of attack is prevented by systems that enable peer authentication such as WebRTC identity <a href="#WEBRTC-SEC" class="xref">[WEBRTC-SEC]</a> or SIP identity <a href="#SIP-ID" class="xref">[SIP-ID]</a>.  However, session concatention remains possible at higher layers: an attacker can establish two independent sessions and simply forward any data it receives from one into the other.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">In the absence of any higher-level concept of peer identity, the use of session identifiers does not prevent session concatenation.  The value to an attacker is limited unless information from the TLS connection is extracted and used with the signaling.  For instance, a key exporter <a href="#EXPORTER" class="xref">[EXPORTER]</a> might be used to create a shared secret or unique identifier that is used in a secondary protocol.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">If a secondary protocol uses the signaling channel with the assumption that the signaling and TLS peers are the same then that protocol is vulnerable to attack unless they also validate the identity of peers at both layers.  Use of the <samp>external_session_id</samp> does not guarantee that the identity of the peer at the TLS layer is the same as the identity of the signaling peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">It is important to note that multiple connections can be created within the same signaling session.  An attacker might concatenate only part of a session, choosing to terminate some connections (and optionally forward data) while arranging to have peers interact directly for other connections.  It is even possible to have different peers interact for each connection.  This means that the actual identity of the peer for one connection might differ from the peer on another connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.6">Information extracted from a TLS connection therefore MUST NOT be used in a secondary protocol outside of that connection if that protocol relies on the signaling protocol having the same peers.  Similarly, data from one TLS connection MUST NOT be used in other TLS connections even if they are established as a result of the same signaling session.</p>
