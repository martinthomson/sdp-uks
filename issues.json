And the victim doesn't really incorrectly\r\n> believe that the media session is \"with\" the attacker, because (like\r\n> every SIP session), it has a media session with the media endpoint that\r\n> the SIP peer directed it to.\r\n\r\nThe draft really needs to address the various expectations of those involved.  Part of what has been assumed here is that the signaling endpoints expect the media endpoints to be the same entities.  If you have internalized 3PCC, that's not an expectation you ever have, but not everyone thinks that way.  The real problem is a mismatch between signaling and reality.\r\n"
